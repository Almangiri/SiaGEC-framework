# SiaGEC Framework
SiaGEC Framework is a Transformer architecture-based Indonesian grammatical error correction system that we proposed for low-resource languages. The framework can be applied to other low-resource language texts. In addition, we proposed a combination of two synthetic data generation methods to generate a large corpus. We constructed a large synthetic corpus of Indonesian language that can be utilized for evaluating future Indonesian GEC research.
